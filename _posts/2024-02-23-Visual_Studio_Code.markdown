# Commentout

1. **Single-line comments:**
   - Place the cursor on the line you want to comment out.
   - Use the shortcut `Command` + `/` (on macOS) or `Ctrl` + `/` (on Windows/Linux).
   
   Example:
   ```ruby
   # say = "I love Ruby"
   # puts say
   ```

2. **Multi-line comments:**
   - Select the block of code you want to comment out.
   - Use the shortcut `Option` + `Shift` + `A` (on macOS) or `Alt` + `Shift` + `A` (on Windows/Linux).

   Example:
   ```ruby
   =begin 
   say['love'] = "*love*"
   puts say.upcase
   =end
   ```
